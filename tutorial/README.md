# Tutorial  
this tutorial will cover the tf.estimator and tf.Dataset, because recently the projects relevant to the BERT use this advanced-packaging api.  

## Details  
tutorial_3.py is an excellent and full tutorial.  

<!-- ## Requirements  
- python 3  
- tensorflow == 1.14 

## Run example  
```shell
python execute.py --type [train, infer]
``` -->
